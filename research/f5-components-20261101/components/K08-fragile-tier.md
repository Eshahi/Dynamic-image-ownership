# K08 — Fragile tier and write order

JUDGMENT — PROPOSED WP1 dossier, not a ruling. Scope: structure, prior evidence and conditional ceilings only. No WP2 literature result or WP3–WP5 improvement verdict is implied. Source: [BRIEF](../BRIEF.md), WP1.

## A. Structure

- SOURCE — h combines coarse DCT structure from a 32-square resampled block-mean map with block-gradient detail from (0,1)/(1,0), then takes 32 sign projections. Detail uses a dead zone, saturation, and a floor; coarse/detail nominal squared shares are 1/4 and 3/4 (`scripts/revised_watermark_v4.py:60-67,466-515`). It is not the semantic descriptor and not a cryptographic instance hash.
- SOURCE — The fragile mark occupies six full-resolution block-DCT positions distinct from those hash detail positions. It is fit with host rejection/amplitude and three corrective passes (`scripts/revised_watermark_v5.py:825-887`; profile `instance_frequencies` and `embedding.passes`). F5 computes h after the initial robust mark, embeds Wi(q,h), robust-refines the image, recomputes h, and re-fits Wi(q,h) (`scripts/f5_latent_codec.py:233-250`). q remains the original fixed semantic code.
- DERIVED — The v4 documentation that its embedder does not modify h's feature planes is not globally true of the complete F5 PGD writer. The final fragile stage preserves those planes before rounding/clipping; the unconstrained robust/refinement stages can change them. The second fragile write is corrective, so it should not simply be counted as two independent 47 dB noise additions.
- SOURCE — F5 does not export intended final h. Transfer evaluation substitutes the embed-report clean decoded h, whereas v5 exports intended h (`scripts/encoder_transfer_runtime.py:160-167`). DERIVED — Exact H/D comparisons have this asymmetry; substituting decoded h does not validate intended-payload recovery.
- DERIVED — Read costs include full-resolution DCT/hash extraction even when only C is reported; write cost includes two three-pass fragile fits. The native C/J endpoint does not depend directly on instance acceptance, but K8 alters robust latent chips through its pixel perturbation. Its removal could change C/J physically and would change F/instance interpretation. Recovery/quality/T4/T5 ceilings are UNKNOWN; no claim that this tier is uniformly useless after every regeneration family follows from its design name.
- SOURCE — The main agent's saved-development supplement reports source-majority instance found/read/exact-H/F counts of 52/37/3/5 under Stage 2 SDXL .1, and 30/19/0/0 under SDXL .2, each out of 60; every listed SD1.5 F5 cell has zero instance-found sources (`research/f5-components-20261101/results/wp1-fragile/REPORT.md:27-35`). DERIVED — Family-independent fragile extinction is contradicted. The older “both_match 0/90 by design” observation cannot be substituted for instance presence, instance read, H, or J in these foreign cells. The detector does not receive the attack identity or force the fragile result to zero after regeneration (`scripts/f5_latent_codec.py:265-311`).

SOURCE: Full interface/null context is in [code structure](../context/wp1-code-structure.md); paths and line locators above refer to inspected repository code. Historical write time 119 s/mark and detector-row time about 1.5 s are environment-specific anchors, not CPU or isolated component timings (BRIEF.md WP5). No new model timing was run.

## B. Prior evidence

SOURCE: The table carries the relevant inspected earlier experiments into this component. Each E-link resolves to the detailed source/report line locators, full numbers, study units and limitations in [prior evidence](../context/wp1-prior-evidence.md). Historical branch blobs were read with git show. SOURCE denotes an inspected report; no historical count below is a new measurement. Frozen held-out reports are contextual only, never a tuning pool.

### Current saved-development accounting and per-cell ceilings

DERIVED: Saved endpoints do not isolate this physical intervention. Its recovery ceiling is UNKNOWN in every observed cell; 60 minus current C is only the arithmetic maximum headroom. Where C=60 there is no positive C count headroom, although J, quality and safety can still differ.

DERIVED: All ceilings are source-level potential increments relative to frozen C/J, not sums of per-call failures. Shared ceilings must not be added across components. Missing calls remain failures in baseline C/J. Every unconstrained new design and every joint strict-quality/T4/T5-safe recovery ceiling is UNKNOWN; current scores contain no new-method negatives or human visual verdict. Protocol: [accounting specification](../analysis/WP1-ACCOUNTING-SPEC.md); endpoint source: scripts/m1b_e3_s1_analysis.py:70–84.

MEASURED/DERIVED: Table inputs are [loss cells](../results/wp1-accounting/loss-cells.csv) and [fragile/semantic endpoint cells](../results/wp1-fragile/fragile-cells.csv), with row-level locators in [component ceilings](../results/component-ceilings.csv) filtered to K08. There are 22 F5 study/cell rows and 22 matched v5 rows in the full accounting; studies are not pooled. Frozen C/J are unchanged. C/J are semantic endpoints; J never means fragile recovery.

SOURCE/JUDGMENT: The Phase-A pilot/law/mechanism records and inactive attack grids have no complete eligible frozen-C/J detector panel from which to infer this component's recovery; their ceilings are UNKNOWN, not zero. Coverage is explicit in [Phase-A coverage](../results/wp1-accounting/phase-a-coverage.csv). Historical smaller development panels above retain their own endpoints/denominators; no per-component source ceiling is reconstructed from report-only totals. Morphology is not a detector panel. No held-out ceiling or tuning table is created.

### Ranking and next literature work

JUDGMENT — PROPOSED: See the [joint loss/cost ranking](../WP1-SYNTHESIS.md#ranking-by-conditional-loss-opportunity-and-cost-to-change) for this component's role and interactions. Changes to this component cannot be credited with a count improvement until the necessary intervention and safety checks exist. The [K08 WP2 query plan](../literature/WP2-QUERY-PLAN.md) lists 15 exact planned queries across five indexes; none has been executed or counted as literature evidence in WP1. Gate 1 precedes that work.
